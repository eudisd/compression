HW # 1
By Eudis Duran


Notes:

1. The Arithmatic codec scheme is coded as a utility in python.
	Run:
		python arithmatic.py inputfile outputfile
		
2. The k-means assignment is implemented simply as an algorithm.
   Run:
		python k-means.py
		
3. The LZW codec scheme is also coded as a utility in python.
	Run: 
		python lzw.py inputfile outputfile
		
		
PS: I have version controlled this assignment.  There is a hidden
dotfile (.hg) that holds the database for all my change sets and logs.  If you wish
to further inspect what I did, 'cd' into my project folder and run:
	hg log
	
(Assuming you have Mercurial installed on your system)
