HW # 1
By Eudis Duran


Notes:

1. The Arithmatic codec scheme is coded as a utility in python.
   The core compression algorithm can be found in the encode() function.
   The decompression algorithm is found in decode(), accordingly.
	Run:
		python arithmatic.py inputfile outputfile	
		
2. The LZW codec scheme is also coded as a utility in python.
   The core compression algorithm can be found in the encode() function.
   The decompression algorithm is found in decode().
	Run: 
		python lzw.py inputfile outputfile
