## Notes:

* The Arithmatic codec scheme is coded as a utility in python.
The core compression algorithm can be found in the encode() function
The decompression algorithm is found in decode(), accordingly.
Run:
> python arithmatic.py inputfile outputfile	
		
* The LZW codec scheme is also coded as a utility in python.
The core compression algorithm can be found in the encode() function.
The decompression algorithm is found in decode().
###Run: 
> python lzw.py inputfile outputfile
